/// #543 — the carry-over selector that keeps the WHOLE recovery side populated at the logical-day
/// rollover. When today isn't scored yet (the new night isn't computed until you wear it tonight), every
/// recovery-derived read-out (the Charge ring, the HRV / resting-HR / respiratory / SpO₂ tiles, the
/// Synthesis / Contributors / Readiness reads) carries the LAST scored day's value, clearly stamped
/// "Last night · <date>", instead of blanking to "No Data" while live HR ticks — the confusing state the
/// reporter hit. This pins the GATE + SELECTION that drives all of that: it must only carry on today,
/// only when today is unscored, only when not mid-calibration, must exclude today's own (still-nil) row,
/// and must pick the freshest scored prior day. Mirrors the Android `lastScoredRecoveryDay` test.
